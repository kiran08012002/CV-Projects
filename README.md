# CV-Projects

 Color Detection:
A program that detects and highlights specific colors in images and videos using OpenCV. This project demonstrates how to isolate and emphasize selected colors in real-time, making it useful for quality control and content creation applications.

Face Detection:
A real-time face detection system using OpenCV. The program uses Haar cascades and deep learning-based methods to detect and track faces through a webcam, highlighting its potential for security and interactive applications.

Security Camera:
A security camera system that records video footage upon detecting motion. This project uses OpenCV to implement motion detection algorithms, providing an efficient solution for environmental monitoring and security enhancement.

Smiling Face Capture:
A program designed to capture images when a person smiles. It uses facial landmark detection and smile recognition algorithms with OpenCV, showcasing the use of computer vision for creating interactive and responsive systems.

Counting Objects:
A small program which uses image processing to count the number of Objects using OpenCV in Python.
